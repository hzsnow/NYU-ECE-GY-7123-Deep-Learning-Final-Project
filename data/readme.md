This is the folder hosting the datasets. We used MovieLens-1M (`movielens_1m.txt`) dataset for training, and used the Wiki1000 dataset (`wikipedia.txt`) for transfer learning. All of the .txt files, except for the `movielens_100k.txt` are obtained from this repo: https://github.com/pmixer/SASRec.pytorch/tree/master, and use blankspace as column seperator. The `movielens_100k.txt` was created by us with the notebook ``  and used tab (`\t`) as column seperator. Anyone using the notebook to load data should be aware of that.
